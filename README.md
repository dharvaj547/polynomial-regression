# Polynomial regression with gradient descent 
A python implementation of polynomial regression using gradient descent. This project generates synthetic data and fits a polynomial regression model to the data using gradient descent optimisation.


## Installation
- You can install the required packages by running the following command in your terminal```pip install -r requirements.txt```


## Data
The data for this project is generated using the 'generate_data.py' script. It generates 1000 data points following a third degree polynomial with random noise. The data is saved to a 'data.csv' file in the same directory as the script.


## Future work
- Write some tests for once
- Generate different sets of data (preferable ones that follow different degree polynomials)
- Refactoring so everything is run from a single file
- Finding a wll to live :)
